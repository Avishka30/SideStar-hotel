      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          SideStar started with a single goal: create a hotel where guests feel like family. In our early days, we focused on quality over quantity, ensuring that every guest was treated with care and attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our reputation grew, so did we. We've expanded to over 80 rooms, added spa services, rooftop dining, and modern amenities — all while keeping our original charm and dedication to service alive.
